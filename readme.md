Read [full changelog](./changelog.md)

# Todo

- Create a CLI that opens a link in the browser, when question id is provided.
- SQL queries are all over the place, they should be organized better.
- Creating lists for questions, categorizing them.
- Modes: i.e. in open mode, on number input, the link is automatically opened. **Edit:** way too trivial so added as default. Cannot think of any other mode for now so...
- usage of arrow keys to select, make UX amazing.
- fetch all question from lists
- a "sync" mechanism that will be used to upload the db file to web, and will be shared across somehow.
- create a gui maybe a web app that starts a http browser locally and opens a link in browser, like expo does?
- maybe firebase
- add gifs of usage

# Done

- CLI (check status of individual commands below)
- crawler routine for scraping metadata of each question, which will be important later on.
